Changes in ATK 6.4.2
--------------------
* Fixed another issue with displaying the correct number of decimals for
  number attributes. The database metadata now only overwrites the number of
  decimals if they aren't explicitly set. If the database metdata specifies
  a different value than is specified in the attribute the lowest number of
  decimals is used. [Peter, Sandy]
